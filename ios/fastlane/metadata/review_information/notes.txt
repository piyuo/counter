Hello Review Team,

Thank you for the detailed review and the feedback provided. Please see my responses to the identified issues below:

Guideline 2.1 – Demo Video File
Although I initially attached the demo video file "1.mp4" with in the App Review Information, it appears that there may have been an issue with accessing the file. To ensure you can review the demo without any further issues, I have re-uploaded "1.mp4" as an attachment in the App Review Information. Additionally, you can download the demo video directly from my website using the following link:

Guideline 5.1.1 – Purpose Strings for Protected Resources
I have updated the purpose strings in the app to more clearly and comprehensively explain the use of protected resources. This update includes detailed examples of how the data is used by the app. The revised purpose strings are available in the latest version, which is now version 1.0.0 Build 5.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your feedback and am happy to provide any further details if needed.

Best regards,
Chien Chih Liu
