This is an app that can automatically detect and count pedestrians, requires no internet connection, and can be used immediately after installation.

Feature Overview
- Real-time people counting: The system detects people walking through the screen and automatically totals the count.
- Offline use: All functions can run locally without internet connection.
- Multiple screen sources: Supports built-in cameras, streaming video, and external cameras (different support depending on platform).
- Long-term recording: Can record continuously for 24 hours and query data for any time period.

How to Use
1. Point the camera at the passageway or entrance you want to monitor.
2. Open the project and select the screen source.
3. After starting, the system will automatically detect and count.

Notes
- Counting accuracy is affected by angle, lighting, obstructions, etc. It's recommended to adjust camera position based on actual conditions.
- While not 100% accurate, using a consistent AI model reduces human error.
- All data processing is completed locally - no images or data are uploaded.

Suitable Scenarios
- Understanding foot traffic in spaces (such as entrances, corridors, exhibition areas).
- Research, event planning, or daily observation.
- Can start using immediately without additional hardware equipment.
