### üèÉ Running Tests

**Primary Method - Flutter Command Line**:

**AI Agents should use the Flutter command line for running tests** as it's more stable and reliable than IDE plugins:

```bash
# Run all tests in the project
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage report
flutter test --coverage

# Run tests in verbose mode
flutter test --verbose

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/path/to/specific_test.dart

# Run tests with custom reporter for better output
flutter test --reporter expanded

# Run tests and watch for changes
flutter test --watch

# Run tests with specific name pattern
flutter test --name "test_pattern"
```

**Why Command Line Over IDE Plugins**:

- **Stability**: Command line tools are more stable and less prone to hanging
- **Consistency**: Same behavior across different development environments
- **Performance**: Faster execution without IDE overhead
- **Debugging**: Clear error messages and stack traces in terminal
- **CI/CD Ready**: Same commands work in continuous integration pipelines

**Alternative Method - VS Code Flutter Test Plugin**:
While the VS Code Flutter test plugin provides UI integration, it can be unstable and may hang during execution. Use it only if you specifically need the visual test runner interface, but be prepared to fall back to command line when issues occur.

## üåç Localization (i18n)

The l10n module provides a streamlined localization system that supports 70+ languages and locales. All translations are managed through a single CSV file for easy maintenance and collaboration.

### üìÅ File Structure

```bash
/lib
  /l10n
    /src                # Internal implementation (private)
      *.arb             # Generated ARB files (do not edit)
      *.dart            # Generated Dart files (do not edit)
    l10n.dart           # Public API (barrel file)
    l10n.csv            # Master translation file (edit this)
```

### üîß How It Works

1. **Central Translation File**: All translations are stored in `/lib/l10n/l10n.csv`
2. **CSV Format**: Standard CSV with key column and locale columns
3. **Automatic Generation**: Script converts CSV to Flutter ARB format and generates Dart code
4. **Module Structure**: The l10n module follows the project's modular architecture with public API and private implementation

### üìù CSV Structure

The `l10n.csv` file follows this format:

```csv
Key,app_af,app_am,app_ar,app_en,app_es,app_fr,app_de,app_ja,app_ko,app_zh,...
back,Terug,·â∞·àò·àà·àµ,ÿ±ÿ¨Ÿàÿπ,Back,Atr√°s,Retour,Zur√ºck,Êàª„Çã,Îí§Î°ú,ËøîÂõû,...
save,Stoor,·ä†·àµ·âÄ·àù·å•,ÿ≠ŸÅÿ∏,Save,Guardar,Sauvegarder,Speichern,‰øùÂ≠ò,Ï†ÄÏû•,‰øùÂ≠ò,...
```

**Column Format**:

- `Key`: Translation key used in your Dart code
- `app_[locale]`: Translation for specific locale (e.g., `app_en` for English, `app_zh_CN` for Chinese Simplified)

### üõ†Ô∏è Adding/Updating Translations

1. **Edit the CSV file**: Open `/lib/l10n/l10n.csv` in any text editor or spreadsheet application
2. **Add new keys**: Add new rows with translation key and values for each locale
3. **Update existing translations**: Modify existing values in the CSV
4. **Generate Flutter files**: Run the convert script

```bash
# build_translation will convert CSV to ARB and generate Dart files
./scripts/build_translation.sh
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: CSV Comma Escaping**
>
> When adding or updating translations in the CSV file, **always escape commas properly**:
>
> - **Text containing commas MUST be wrapped in double quotes**: `"Hello, world"`
> - **Double quotes within text must be escaped with double quotes**: `"She said ""Hello"""`
> - **Failure to escape commas will cause column misalignment and build errors**
>
> **Examples**:
>
> ```csv
> Key,app_en,app_es,app_fr
> greeting,"Hello, welcome!","¬°Hola, bienvenido!","Bonjour, bienvenue!"
> quote_example,"She said ""Hello""","Ella dijo ""Hola""","Elle a dit ""Bonjour"""
> ```

This script:

- Converts `l10n.csv` to standard Flutter ARB files in `/lib/l10n/src/`
- Automatically runs `flutter gen-l10n` to generate Dart localization classes
- Creates ready-to-use localization files in your project

### üíª Usage in Code

After running the generation script, use translations in your Flutter code with the convenient `context.l` extension:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_appkit/l10n/l10n.dart';

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Text(context.l.back);        // Displays "Back" in current locale
  }
}
```

### üìã Best Practices

- **Keep keys descriptive**: Use clear, meaningful keys like `login_button` instead of `btn1`
- **Use CSV tools**: Edit the CSV in spreadsheet applications for easier management
- **‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS escape commas**: Wrap text containing commas in double quotes to prevent column misalignment
- **Test translations**: Verify translations in context, especially for RTL languages
- **Consistent terminology**: Maintain consistent terminology across all locales
- **Handle pluralization**: Use ICU message format for complex pluralization rules when needed

### üîÑ Workflow for Teams

1. **Developers**: Add new translation keys to CSV with English values
2. **Translators**: Fill in translations for their assigned locales
3. **Build Process**: Run `./scripts/build_translation.sh` to generate files
4. **Version Control**: Commit both CSV and generated files to ensure consistency

### üö® Important Notes

- **Never edit generated files**: Only modify `l10n.csv` directly
- **‚ö†Ô∏è ALWAYS escape commas in CSV**: Text containing commas must be wrapped in double quotes (`"Hello, world!"`) to prevent build errors
- **Run script after changes**: Always run the generation script after CSV updates
- **Commit generated files**: Include generated `.arb` and `.dart` files in version control
- **Test thoroughly**: Test your app in different locales to ensure proper display and functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Tools

These tools support local development, collaboration, and testing:

- **Visual Studio Code** ‚Äì Recommended code editor with official Flutter and Dart extensions.
- **Flutter SDK** ‚Äì The software development kit itself, including the Dart SDK, Flutter framework, command-line tools (flutter doctor, flutter run, flutter build), and engine for compiling and running applications across platforms.
- **Git** ‚Äì Version control for managing source code.
- **GitHub CLI (gh)** ‚Äì Streamlines GitHub workflows (issues, pull requests, etc.).

```bash
./scripts/upgrade_deps.sh
```

## ‚úÖ Best Practices to Follow

These practices guide our development to ensure code quality, maintainability, performance, and scalability:

- We are **migrating from Provider to Riverpod** for improved scalability and testability.
- **Follow the Effective Dart Style Guide**: Adhere to Dart's official style guide for consistent formatting, naming conventions (e.g., `UpperCamelCase` for classes, `lowerCamelCase` for variables), and code structure. This is enforced via `flutter_lints` and `dart format`.
- **Embrace Widget Composition over Inheritance**: Favor composing smaller, reusable widgets to build complex UIs. This leads to cleaner code, better performance, and easier testing compared to deep inheritance hierarchies.
- **Optimize Widget Rebuilds**:
  - **Use `const` constructors whenever possible**: For immutable widgets, using `const` allows Flutter to perform significant optimizations by reusing widget instances and preventing unnecessary rebuilds.
  - **Keep `build` methods pure and lean**: Avoid complex logic, heavy computations, or network calls directly within `build` methods, as they can run frequently. Delegate such operations to state management solutions or lifecycle methods.
  - **Minimize `setState()` scope**: Use `setState()` sparingly and only for the smallest possible widget subtree that needs to update. Prefer robust state management solutions (like Provider, BLoC, Riverpod) for broader or more complex state changes.
- **State Management**: Utilize `Provider` (or your chosen state management solution) for managing application state, ensuring clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic.
  - **Keep state as low as possible**: Place `ChangeNotifier`s or other state objects at the lowest common ancestor in the widget tree to limit the scope of rebuilds.
- **Proper Resource Management**:
  - **Dispose of controllers and streams**: Always `dispose()` of `TextEditingController`, `ScrollController`, `AnimationController`, `StreamSubscription`s, and similar resources when the corresponding `StatefulWidget` is unmounted (`@override void dispose() { super.dispose(); }`). This prevents memory leaks.
  - **Handle asynchronous operations safely**: Always check `mounted` before calling `setState()` after an `await` to prevent errors if the widget is unmounted while the operation is pending.
- **Implement Robust Error Handling**:
  - Use `try-catch` blocks for asynchronous operations (e.g., network requests, file operations).
  - Consider using custom `Exception` classes for application-specific error types.
  - Utilize `flutter_appkit`'s error handling capabilities for consistent error reporting and user feedback.
- **Write Comprehensive Tests**:
  - **Unit Tests**: For business logic, utilities, and individual functions.
  - **Widget Tests**: To verify UI components behave as expected and render correctly.
  - **Integration Tests**: To test interactions between multiple widgets or entire features, simulating user flows.
  - **Strive for good test coverage**: Focus on critical functionalities and edge cases.
- **Implement Responsive and Adaptive UI**: Design UIs that gracefully adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and device types (mobile, tablet, web, desktop). Leverage `MediaQuery`, `LayoutBuilder`, and `Sliver` widgets.
- **Use Material Design (or Cupertino)**: Adhere to established design guidelines for a consistent and high-quality user experience.
- **Prioritize Performance**:
  - Optimize image assets (e.g., compress, use `CachedNetworkImage` for network images).
  - Employ lazy loading for lists (e.g., `ListView.builder`).
  - Use `SizedBox` or `Sliver` widgets for spacing and layout over overly complex `Container`s when simple sizing is needed.
- **Maintain Clean Code Structure**: Organize code logically into feature-based directories, clearly separating UI, business logic, services, and models.

## üö´ What to Avoid

These are common pitfalls and anti-patterns that can lead to performance issues, bugs, and maintainability challenges:

- **Avoid using the old Provider package** ‚Äì we are standardizing on Riverpod going forward.
- **Avoid over-reliance on `setState()`**: Do not use `setState()` for global state or for changes that affect large parts of the widget tree. This leads to unnecessary rebuilds and poor performance.
- **Never block the UI thread**: Avoid performing heavy computations, large file I/O, or synchronous network requests directly on the main UI thread. Use `async/await`, `Isolates`, or background services to offload work.
- **Do not hardcode sensitive information**: API keys, sensitive credentials, or environment-specific configurations should *never* be hardcoded into the source code. Use environment variables or secure configuration methods.
- **Avoid excessive nesting (Widget Tree Depth)**: While composition is good, overly deep or convoluted widget trees can become hard to read and debug. Break down complex widgets into smaller, named components.
- **Do not initialize controllers/resources in `build()`**: Avoid creating `AnimationController`, `TextEditingController`, `StreamController`, etc., directly within `build` methods. These should be initialized once in `initState()` and disposed in `dispose()`.
- **Avoid using `print()` for production logging**: `print()` calls can be inefficient and stripped in release builds. Use `debugPrint()` for local debugging or integrate a dedicated logging package (like `logger`) for structured logging that can be controlled by build configurations.
- **Do not ignore `Future`s or `Stream`s**: Ensure all `Future`s are `await`ed or handled with `.then().catchError()`. Similarly, `StreamSubscription`s must be `cancel()`ed. Unhandled futures or streams can lead to unexpected behavior or memory leaks.
- **Avoid global variables for state**: While `GetIt` is a service locator, avoid using simple global variables (`static`) for mutable application state. This makes state harder to track, test, and manage, and can lead to unexpected side effects.
- **Don't ship unused code/assets**: Remove commented-out code, unused imports, and unreferenced assets to keep the bundle size small and the codebase clean.
- **Avoid `as` casts without `is` checks**: Use the `is` operator before casting with `as` to prevent runtime exceptions (e.g., `if (object is MyType) { (object as MyType).doSomething(); }`).

## üì¶ Modular Project Architecture

This project follows a **feature-based modular architecture** where each feature is organized as a self-contained module with clear boundaries and public APIs. This approach promotes better code organization, maintainability, and reusability in larger Flutter applications.

### üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

```bash
/lib
  /pip                    # PIP feature module
    /src                  # Internal implementation (private)
      pip_footer.dart     # Private implementation files
      pip_screen.dart     # Private implementation files
    pip.dart              # Public API (barrel file)
  /db                     # Database UI feature module
    /src                  # Internal implementation (private)
      database.dart       # Private implementation files
      data_manager.dart   # Private implementation files
    db.dart               # Public API (barrel file)
  /l10n                   # Localization module
    /src                  # Internal implementation (private)
      *.arb               # Generated ARB files (do not edit)
      *.dart              # Generated Dart files (do not edit)
    l10n.dart             # Public API (barrel file)
    l10n.csv              # Master translation file (edit this)
  main.dart               # App entry point
```

### üéØ Module Design Principles

Each feature module follows these key principles:

1. **Encapsulation**: Internal implementation details are kept in the `/src` folder and are private to the module
2. **Public API**: Each module exposes only what's necessary through its barrel file (e.g., `pip.dart`, `db.dart`, `l10n.dart`)
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces, preventing tight coupling
4. **Self-Contained**: Each module contains all the code needed for its specific feature or functionality

### üí° Usage Examples

**Import modules with namespace aliases for better organization:**

```dart
// Import modules with descriptive aliases
import 'package:counter/db/db.dart' as db;
import 'package:counter/pip/pip.dart' as pip;
import 'package:counter/l10n/l10n.dart';  // l10n is typically imported without alias

class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        db.PipScreen(),           // Use DB module components
        pip.DataManager(),        // Use PIP module components
        Text(context.l.back),     // Use l10n translations
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

**Module barrel files expose public APIs:**

```dart
// In /lib/db/db.dart (barrel file)
export 'src/pip_footer.dart';
export 'src/pip_screen.dart';
// Only export what should be public - keep internal helpers private

// In /lib/pip/pip.dart (barrel file)
export 'src/data_manager.dart';
export 'src/database.dart';
// Internal utilities stay private in /src

// In /lib/l10n/l10n.dart (barrel file)
export 'src/app_localizations.dart';
export 'src/app_localizations_extensions.dart';
// Generated ARB and Dart files stay private in /src
```

### ‚ú® Benefits of This Architecture

- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Reusability**: Modules can be easily reused across different parts of the application
- **Team Collaboration**: Different team members can work on different modules independently
- **Testing**: Each module can be tested in isolation with clear boundaries
- **Clean Imports**: Namespace aliases keep imports organized and prevent naming conflicts

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Add New Modules

1. **Create the module directory structure**:
   ```bash
   /lib
     /your_new_feature
       /src
         internal_service.dart     # Private implementation
         helper_utils.dart         # Private utilities
       your_new_feature.dart       # Public API barrel file
   ```

2. **Define the public API** in the barrel file:
   ```dart
   // In /lib/your_new_feature/your_new_feature.dart
   export 'src/internal_service.dart';
   // Only export what other modules need to use
   ```

3. **Use the module** in your app:
   ```dart
   import 'package:counter/your_new_feature/your_new_feature.dart' as feature;

   // Use with clear namespace
   feature.InternalService()
   ```

### üìå Module Guidelines

- **Keep `/src` truly private**: Only expose what other modules genuinely need through the barrel file
- **Use meaningful module names**: Choose names that clearly represent the feature or domain
- **Maintain module independence**: Avoid circular dependencies between modules
- **Document public APIs**: Clearly document what each module exposes and how to use it
- **Consider module size**: If a module grows too large, consider splitting it into smaller, focused modules

This modular architecture, also known as the **"barrel file" pattern**, is a well-established practice in Dart/Flutter projects that helps maintain clean, organized, and scalable codebases as your application grows.
