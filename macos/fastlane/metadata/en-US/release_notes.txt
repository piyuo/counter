Bug Fixes

- Fixed a crash that occurred when closing a project after 30 seconds. The application should now close projects reliably without crashing.
- Resolved an issue causing some devices to display an upside-down image from the front camera. The front camera now functions correctly on all supported devices.
- Corrected several incorrect language translations. The application's translations are now more accurate across all supported languages.
- Addressed a bug where the app would get stuck when camera permissions were not granted. The application now handles denied camera access gracefully without freezing.
